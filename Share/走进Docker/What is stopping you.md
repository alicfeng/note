**What is stopping you?**

是什么在阻止你？



What's stopping you?
Are you too tired?
Didn't get enough sleep?
Don't have enough energy?
Don't have enough time?
Don't have enough money?
It that what's stopping you right now?
Is that the thing?
Or is the thing that's stopping you, 
you?
Excuses sound best to the person who's making them up. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Get off the pity potty, telling everybody you're sad and sob stories, trying to get people to show up your pity parties and your pity parades.

If you ever see me in a rolls royce a 6 or 7 star hotel, living my life to the fullest don't get jealous of me. Because I worked my ass off to get it. Nobody handed me nothing.
Woke your ass up. Awaken the beast inside.
It's game on. 
It's go aeason.
It's time for you to take advantage of the access and the resources that you have in your country and youtr community.
You got a problem your life? You got a problem your environment? Do something about it. If you want it, go get it. Recognise the excuses are not valid. They're conjured up, They're fabricated, They're lies. And how do you stop the lies?
You stop the lies with the truth and the truth is you have time, you have skill, you have the knowledge and the support and the willpower and discipline to get it done. The fruit of everything good in life begins with a challenge.
